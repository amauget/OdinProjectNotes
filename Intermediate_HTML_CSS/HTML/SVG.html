    <!-- What are SVGs?
    SVGs are a scalable image format, which means they will easily scale to any 
    size and retain their quality without increasing their filesize. 
    Theyâ€™re also very useful if you need to create or modify your images programmatically,
     because you can change their properties through CSS and JavaScript. -->

    <!-- USES:
    SVGs are often used for:

    Icons
    Graphs/Charts
    Large, simple images
    Patterned backgrounds
    Applying effects to other elements via SVG filters 

    The image rendering is defined by math oposed to traditional "raseter grahpics"
    This means that img size can be scaled without changing the file size.

    SVGs ARE WRITTEN IN XML.. CODE CAN BE EMBEDDED INTO HTML. EX BELOW:-->

    <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100">
                                                <!--viewBox= page proportions -->
        <rect x=0 y=0 width=100 height=50 />
        <circle class="svg-circle" cx="50" cy="50" r="10"/>
    </svg>
    svg breakdown: xmlns stands for xml namespace: Specifies what dialect of xml is being used.
    viewBox: defines the bounds of SVG.  Dfines different points of the elements in SVG.
    It also defines the aspect ratio and origin of SVGs

    Elements such as <circle>, <rect>, <path>, and <text> are defined by the SVG namespace.
            These are our basic building-blocks.

    <!-- Do not use for complex images as every component is to be written in XML -->

    <!-- EMBEDDING SVGs:
        They can be linked like any other image, however contents from
        svg will not be accessible from html
    
        OR 
    
        INLINE the SVG like above. This has drawbacks as it can slow page,
        , make code less cacheable, and make code less readable
        -->
