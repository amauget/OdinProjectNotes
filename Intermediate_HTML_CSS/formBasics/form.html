<!-- The form element is a container followed by action
    (Where the data should be sent) and finally the 
    "method" which is usually either "get" or "post"

GET: is used when we want to retrieve something from the server
such as a search request.

POST: is used when we want to change something on the server
for example, when a user makes an account.-->

    ex.
    <form action="example.com/path" method="post">

    </form>

<!-- Form Controls:
All interactable elements on the form (buttons, dropdowns etc) -->

<!-- One of which is "input" -->
<form action="example.com/path" method="post">
    <input type="text">
  </form>


<!-- Labels:
 -->
 <form action="example.com/path" method="post">
    <label for="first_name">First Name:</label>
    <input type="text" id="first_name">
  </form>

  <!-- the label accepts "for" to associate it with an id -->


  <!-- Placeholder Attribute -->
  <label for="first_name">First Name:</label>
<input type="text" id="first_name" placeholder="Bob...">

<!-- Placeholder is used to guide users with an example, in 
this case the text box will start with bob until entry is made. -->



<!-- Name attribute:
Used to let the backend know what the data represents -->

<label for="first_name">First Name:</label>
<input type="text" id="first_name" name="first_name">

<!-- FORM DOESN'T REQUIRE BACK END.. CAN BE USED W/ VANILLA JS 
to display data on the page.-->
