<!-- It's good practice to use <li> element to wrap a label and widget. -->

<!-- <p> and <div> elements are also commonly used. Lists are recommended 
    for structuring multiple checkboxes or radio buttons. -->

<!-- In addition to the <fieldset> element, it's also common practice to 
    use HTML titles (e.g. h1, h2) and sectioning (e.g. <section>) to structure complex forms. -->

<!-- Each separate section of functionality should be contained in a separate <section> 
    element, with <fieldset> elements to contain radio buttons. -->
