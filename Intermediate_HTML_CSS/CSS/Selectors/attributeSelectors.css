  /* Child selector */
  h1>p /* Where p is a child of h1 */

  /* sibling selector */
  h1~p /* Where h1 and p share a common parent. */

  /* Adjacent sibling selector */
  h1 + p /* Where p is directly next to h1. all other p's will be omited. */



[attribute] - This general selector will select anything where the given attribute exists. Its value doesnâ€™t matter.

selector[attribute] - Optionally we can combine our attribute selectors with other types of selectors, such as class or element selectors.

[attribute="value"] - To get really specific, we can use = to match a specific attribute with a specific value.

[src] {
    /* This will target any element that has a src attribute. */
  }

  img[src] {
    /* This will only target img elements that have a src attribute. */
  }

  img[src="puppy.jpg"] {
    /* This will target img elements with a src attribute that is exactly "puppy.jpg" */
  }

  /* Can also be used to isolate letters, file types, etc */
  [class^='aus'] {
    /* Classes are attributes too!
      This will target any class that begins with 'aus':
      class='austria'
      class='australia'
    */
  }
  [src$='.jpg'] {
    /* This will target any src attribute that ends in '.jpg':
    src='puppy.jpg'
    src='kitten.jpg'
    */
  }
  
  [for*='ill'] {
    /* This will target any for attribute that has 'ill' anywhere inside it:
    for="bill"
    for="jill"
    for="silly"
    for="ill"
    */
  }

  /* Attibute Hyphenated Selectors
  When an attribute value is hyphen-separated, rather than whitespace-separated, the vertical line character, |,
   may be used within the square brackets of a selector between the attribute name and equals sign. The vertical
    line denotes that the attribute value may be hyphen-separated however the hyphen-separated words must begin with the stated value. */
