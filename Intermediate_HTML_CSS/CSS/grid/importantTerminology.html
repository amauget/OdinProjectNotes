<!-- Important CSS Terminology
grid line: the dividing lines that make up the structure of the grid.
            They can be vertical or horizontal

Grid cell: interior area of surrounding grid lines.

grid track: space between to adjacent grid lines, accounts for all cells on that plane.

grid area: the total space surrounded by FOUR grid lines, 
            This doesn't necessarily mean four cells. If there are 4col 4rows:
            and the four grid lines are the 4 exterior lines, it would be the area
            of all 16 cells.

RESIZE: BOTH -> This is a property that allows the user to resize the container by clicking and 
                dragging from the bottom right corner.
