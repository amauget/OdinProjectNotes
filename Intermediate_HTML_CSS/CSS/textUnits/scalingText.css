  /* Clamping Text
  The clamp() function is like the calc() function but
   it takes three values. The middle value is the same 
   as what you pass to calc(). The opening value 
   specifies the minimum size, in this case 1rem so as 
   to not go below the user's preferred font size. The 
   closing value specifies the maximum size. */

  /* Line Length */
  /* You can't set a line length directly in CSS. 
  There is no line-length property. But you can stop text from 
  getting too wide by limiting how wide the container can be.
