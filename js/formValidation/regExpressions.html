    Regexps are quite complex, and we don't intend to teach you them exhaustively in this article. Below are some examples to give you a basic idea of how they work.

a — Matches one character that is a (not b, not aa, and so on).
abc — Matches a, followed by b, followed by c.
ab?c — Matches a, optionally followed by a single b, followed by c. (ac or abc)
ab*c — Matches a, optionally followed by any number of bs, followed by c. (ac, abc, abbbbbc, and so on).
a|b — Matches one character that is a or b.
abc|xyz — Matches exactly abc or exactly xyz (but not abcxyz or a or y, and so on).
 example below:
   -->
   <form>
    <label for="choose">Would you prefer a banana or a cherry?</label>
    <input id="choose" name="i-like" required pattern="[Bb]anana|[Cc]herry" />

    <label for="number">How many would you like?</label>
    <input type="number" id="number" name="amount" value="1" min="1" max="10" /> <!-- Limits min/max entry values. -->
    <button>Submit</button>
  </form>
</body>
