Scenario:
  You need to pull in data from an API or database. An array of 1000 users comes back and you now need to sort
  this array into alphabetical order.
    Using an algo with linear time where n is the input size, then there will be around 1000 operations
    
    Using an algo with n^2 results in 1 million operations...
