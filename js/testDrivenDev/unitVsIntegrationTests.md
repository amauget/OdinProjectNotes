Definitions:

Unit Test: 
  Tests individual units (modules, functions, classes) in isolation from the rest of the program

Integration Test:
  Tests integration between 2 or more units, or functional tests, which test the app from the point of view of the user. This can go so far as to integrate user interaction workflows throughout to add context.
